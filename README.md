## Problem Statement

Smaller, non-profit organizations like food pantries and re-sale stores rely on donations
for a most of their inventory. Pantries might be getting food donations from multiple
businesses in town every day, and the volunteers there have to record them all in a
notebook. Not just food donations, but things like clothes, household items, toys, etc. from community
members as well, and there is no real way we are tracking any of these. The amounts,
values, weights, kinds, and who donated them are all information that we need to have at
the end of the year.

Often times individuals are tracking and managing those donations by hand in a notebook or in
a spreadsheet. This is time-consuming and in efficient. This is an application that will let users record
donations as they come, and then let managers be able to search through the recordings
using different search options. It will return a summary that the manager can use for
finances or other reasons, or to share with donors. It is open source and free to use for any non-profit
organizations.
