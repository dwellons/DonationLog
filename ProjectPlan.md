# Project Plan

### Week 2
- [X] Create project repository on GitHub
- [X] Create project structure in intellij and push
- [X] Add link to list of indie projects in student repo.
- [X] Complete Problem Statement
- [X] Weekly reflection/time log

### Week 3
- [ ] Research possible Web Services/APIs to use
- [X] List technologies, versions and how they will be used
- [ ] Write project plan
- [X] Document user stories and select MVP stories
- [X] Confirm MVP stories meet Ent Java indie project objectives
- [ ] Design screens - make sure all MVP user stories are covered
- [ ] Triple-check for Checkpoint 1
- [ ] Update journal/time log/reflection - I should probably just use one :)

For those using this as a model, continue adding weekly tasks by considering:
1. which user story will you work on in a given week
2. detail the tasks needed to complete that user story
3. what we are doing in class each week and what you might add to your project as a result, either in that week or the following week
4. add in project checkpoints/milestones and tasks to achieve them
5. I started a few of these below as examples
