||| Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement|
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| - I think the problem statement does a good job explaining the purpose of the application and how it can be helpful to DM's. <br>- Your problem statement looks professional and I don't see any typo's. <br>- You do a good job explaining the terms that might be unfamiliar. <br> - I'm not sure if it would be helpful to define plot arc or if it is a well known part of the game.
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | - I think the way your screens are designed and how the application will work will make it quick and easy to use and will let more of the game be played. <br>- The traits are displayed in the order you mentioned in the Masters Guide. I like that you will have the ability to "re roll" to choose a new trait if you want. <br>- The data mentioned in the problem statement as *MVP and in the user stories is all planned for. <br>- Would generating a villan require different traits than the ones that a generated NPC will be given, or would you be able to create a villan using the traits you have created already? <br>- I think it would be cool to have the theme of the application match the game in a way.
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| - The information explainted in the problem statement is in the database.<br> - I think your database looks great and well structured, I was really impressed by it and how organized it looks. <br>- There are multiple one to many relationships. <br>- I think having an image associated with the traits would be a cool feature to implement in the future.
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverage.  7. No sensitive information is visible in the repository (secrets, passwords, etc). | - The code that you have written looks clean and well structured! <br>- I think like you mentioned, adding the database configuration files, logs etc. to your .gitignore file is a good idea to hide passwords, etc. <br>- None of the classes are huge and each serves its own purpose. <br>- The unit testing that you have for your InteractionTraits.java class is checking for CRUD <br>- The only little thing that stood out to me was that some of the comments have capitalization, punctuation and some don't.  

You have a great project idea and I think a lot of people are going to find this to be super useful. I also had a hard time finding suggestions, you have a solid start so far and everything you have is impressively clean and well-structured. You're ready for some JSP's and I'm excited to see how you make them, and the final product!
